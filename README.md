# About
I made this back in 2015 when I was still a senior in high school.  I haven't touched this project since then.  It's just a little game where you control a triangle spaceship and try to shoot some other spaceships around you.

# Controls
Arrow keys to move, space to shoot.

# Running the Game
Open `Dodge_And_Shoot.java` in your favorite Java IDE and run it.  The last time I checked in 2015 it ran just fine.
